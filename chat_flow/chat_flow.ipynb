These tasks can range from image recognition to natural language processing, depending on the modules implemented.\\n\\nWe utilize TensorFlow for building and training neural networks. The agents are organized in a modular fashion, allowing for easy expansion and customization. Each agent operates independently but can communicate with others via a message-passing system to achieve more complex objectives.\\n\\nIntegration tests are in place to ensure reliability and performance. Deployment scripts and Docker configurations are provided to facilitate deployment in diverse environments. Feel free to check the detailed documentation and examples included in the repository to understand how to initialize and train each agent for your specific needs.'\n"
